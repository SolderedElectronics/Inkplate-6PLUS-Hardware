### Snap case and brackets for Inkplate 6PLUS


Another case design for the Inkplate 6PLUS. This case requires no screws, instead the cover snaps onto the base. Mounting
as designed is via 4 slots in the back, and there are accompanying brackets for wall or desk mounting.

The test example was printed in PLA on a Makergear M3 printer. Supports are not required except for the wall
bracket.

Included are 3mf files for all components, ready to import into a slicer, but also the Fusion360 source, allowing
modifications to be made.

Note that for the desk stand two of the "Desk mount bracket" pieces are required.
